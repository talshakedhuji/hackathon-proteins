## Input:
1. model_path - a nanonet trained network model path.
2. fasta - a “.fasta” file path with a sequence of amino-acids, representing a nanobody to run the tool on.
3. num_of_mutations - the number of mutations-iterations to perform and create a mutated model

## Output:
1. mutations distributions.png - Plots the mutations distribution, based on “Position Index” over “# of Mutations”
2. rmsd_by_id.png - Plots the RMSDs of the different sequences based on “RMSD” over “Mutation ids”
3. mean_rmsd_by_amount.png - Present a bar plot of “Mean RMSD vs Mutation Amount”
4. good_freq.png and bad_freq.png - present the logo figures for the "good" and "bad" sequences (by rmsd score), for the frequency of AA mutations
5. align_img.png - an Alignment of the created model structures with the input model, based on the Fasta sequence. The Reference will be colored Yellow and all the mutated models will be colored Green.

## Tool’s Brief:
Given a path to nanonet model (“model_path”), a .fasta file with a nanobody sequence (“fasta”) and a number of mutations to perform (“num_of_mutations”),
Our tool:
* Uses the network to predict the structure of the given Nanobody sequence.
* Run a mutation process (for “num_of_mutations” iterations) and creates a mutated sequence:
   * Calculating the number of mutations to perform, based on the Distribution of mutation, pre-calculated by alignment on the DB of nanobodies sequence.
   * Mutating the sequence randomly with AminoAcids, in the CDRs positions, based on an existing known Distribution of AminoAcids appearance in nature.
* Perform a prediction of the mutated sequence, using the nanonet model.
* Calculating the RMSD between the new mutated model and the source one.
* Constructing a summary of graphs based on the results together with an Alignment Image of the models.
