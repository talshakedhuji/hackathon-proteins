README


Input:
1. model_path - a nanonet trained network model path.
2. fasta - a “.fasta” file path with a sequence of amino-acids, representing a nanobody to run the tool on.
3. num_of_mutations - the number of mutations-iterations to perform and create a mutated model
Output:
1. mutations distributions.png - Plots the mutations distribution, based on “Position Index” over “# of Mutations”
2. rmsd_by_id.png - Plots the RMSDs of the different sequences based on “RMSD” over “Mutation ids”
3. mean_rmsd_by_amount.png - Present a bar plot of “Mean RMSD vs Mutation Amount”
4. good_freq.png and bad_freq.png - present the logo figures for the "good" and "bad" sequences (by rmsd score), for the frequency of AA mutations
5. align_img.png - an Alignment of the created model structures with the input model, based on the Fasta sequence. The Reference will be colored Yellow and all the mutated models will be colored Green.

Tool’s Brief:
Given a path to nanonet model (“model_path”), a .fasta file with a nanobody sequence (“fasta”) and a number of mutations to perform (“num_of_mutations”),
Our tool:
* Uses the network to predict the structure of the given Nanobody sequence.
* Run a mutation process (for “num_of_mutations” iterations) and creates a mutated sequence:
   * Calculating the number of mutations to perform, based on the Distribution of mutation, pre-calculated by alignment on the DB of nanobodies sequence.
   * Mutating the sequence randomly with AminoAcids, in the CDRs positions, based on an existing known Distribution of AminoAcids appearance in nature.
* Perform a prediction of the mutated sequence, using the nanonet model.
* Calculating the RMSD between the new mutated model and the source one.
* Constructing a summary of graphs based on the results together with an Alignment Image of the models.
